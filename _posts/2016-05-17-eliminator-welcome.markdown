21 Athletes. 20 Laps. 1 Eliminator.
Are you strong enough? Are you fast enough? Do you have what it takes to be the last one standing?

The Eliminator is designed to be a track race focused on competitiveness. As coaches we constantly
preach competitiveness but the athletes still focus on times. A bad time is a bad day to them and
we simply don't agree.
In our experience, many athletes struggle to stay within themselves during big workouts. Instead 
they compete with their teammates to be the best that day. Well, coaches don't want that during 
practice so we decided to createan outlet for those competitive athletes. Here's your workout 
(repeat 400m). Who can be the best? Don't run your pre-determined pace. Don't hold back. Race and
race hard. Be the last one standing. Be the Eliminator.
